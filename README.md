Project Overview <br />
The recommendation system extracts image features using CNNs and clusters similar images. The model can be fine-tuned to improve accuracy and is suitable for applications in e-commerce and personal styling platforms. This project demonstrates how to build a fashion recommendation system using image features and machine learning. The model analyzes visual patterns from clothing images to suggest fashion recommendations based on similar attributes.

Features <br />
Deep Learning: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.<br />
Image Processing: Processes and analyzes fashion images.<br />
Recommendations: Provides item suggestions based on visual similarities.<br />

Libraries Used <br />
PIL (Pillow): For image processing. <br />
matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization.<br />
glob: For finding files matching a pattern.<br />
tensorflow: For deep learning.<br />
numpy: For numerical computing.<br />
scipy.spatial.distance: For calculating distances (cosine similarity).<br />

Installation<br />
pip install -r requirements.txt<br />

Usage <br />
