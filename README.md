Project Overview
The recommendation system extracts image features using CNNs and clusters similar images. The model can be fine-tuned to improve accuracy and is suitable for applications in e-commerce and personal styling platforms. This project demonstrates how to build a fashion recommendation system using image features and machine learning. The model analyzes visual patterns from clothing images to suggest fashion recommendations based on similar attributes.

Features
Deep Learning: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
Image Processing: Processes and analyzes fashion images.
Recommendations: Provides item suggestions based on visual similarities.

Libraries Used
PIL (Pillow): For image processing.
matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization.
glob: For finding files matching a pattern.
tensorflow: For deep learning.
numpy: For numerical computing.
scipy.spatial.distance: For calculating distances (cosine similarity).
